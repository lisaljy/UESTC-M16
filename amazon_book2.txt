content：Just received my copy. Excellently packed and shrink wrapped. A few things of note. I have order several Batman graphic novels from amazon recently, and this volume is one of the finest. The pages are very heavy stock, unlike some I could mention....ahem "the joker".... The dust jacket is also very thick and resilient. The pages are bright pure white and the colors are magnificent. I rarely write product reviews, but am so pleasantly surprised with the quality that I just had to post. One other thing, this edition is larger than your standard graphic novel, which I didn't realize prepurchase. Oh yeah and of course you would be looking at this item without knowing it is one of the best ever in the comics medium, so there's that. Overall 5 strong stars

time：on March 25, 2016
content：This is a great comic aside from one thing. I absolutely HATE the Joker origin story. You really want to tell me that the Joker, this unspeakable force of pure mayhem started as this lamewad dude and his insanity is basically superpowers caused by chemicals? No thank you. Joker was perfect as this concrete, horrifying certainty, and while I suppose his origins do warrant some level of interest, this just felt really lazy and like a huge missed opportunity. Were Joker to simply be a character who's constructed by his environment like Batman was, it would create even more parallels between the two. They would both be men of extremities but also men of limits because of their species. Other than that, this was a demented pleasure; I own a copy of the original printing and of the deluxe because the colors in both of them were so cool I couldn't pass either edition up :)

He knows how to take something and flip it on its ears and make us see it a way it's never been seen before.
