It does not come with a memory card but you can get them on Amazon. But the interface is very easy to use and the menu can be made into a more general less detaile done for a child his age. I love love this small compact sleek camera. It also takes stunning photos.

time：on June 3, 2016
content：This says "USB cable" as the connection method, they fail to mention that the "B" connector is a proprietary connector.  The included cable is far too short and won't even let me sit the camera on my desk while plugged in to a front USB connector.  Apparently Sony wants to force you to buy a cable from them, even if you have a dozen cables that fit 99%+ of modern devices.

reviewer：J. Cofer
time：on June 28, 2016
content：I'm not sure why this camera is getting such glowing reviews. As a point-and-shoot for daytime vacation photos, this camera is perfectly serviceable. At nighttime, or under any kind of "challenging" conditions (such as a concert), the camera is SLOW as molasses to take pictures, and the pictures are often washed out or out of focus. On vacation in Europe I took (no joke) 50+ pictures of the Grand Place in Brussels at night, and NOT ONE came out decently - all were extremely grainy or horribly out of focus, or both. However, pictures I took with my cell phone came out fine (given that it was a 5MP camera on a $79 phone). Also, pictures I took with my GF's *cheaper* Canon P&S looked fine. So it's not entirely me. I also took this camera with me to a recent CHVRCHES concert: despite being less than 30 feet from the stage, the pics I took with this camera are AWFUL - the pics taken with the 8MP camera on my (new) phone look a hundred times better. It's almost as if the firmware is somehow "off" on this camera or something. All I know is, this is my fourth digital P&S camera, and this is the worst one BY FAR - even the godawful HP digital camera I owned back in 2002 took better low-light pictures than this camera. Also, the battery latch has a nasty habit of popping open in my pocket, something that's never once happened with the HP and Canon cameras I've owned in the past.

Terrible for travel if all of your gear is USB...except for this darn thing. I've had a lot of Sony cameras in the past and they were great..but this model is a joke.

content：I got this camera because the reviews were so great. After receiving the camera I checked it out. Had some cool settings I was pretty stoked about my purchase. Then I started to use it. My issues with this camera were A. It takes forever to take a picture. I mean there is no such thing as a Kodak moment with this one. It is a kodak minute which means no natural shots of the kids. I hate that. Problem B, If anyone in the picture is moving at all, it is blurry. So no action shots at all. Problem C. The few good pictures that I did get by staying perfectly still and having them stay perfectly still were not able to be zoomed in at all or cropped as they got grainy. Now, I'm gonna be honest here. I expect a lot from my camera. I am picky, maybe some of you guys are happy not cropping photos, I am not. I edit almost half of my photos and with 4 kids I take a lot of pictures. So anyhow, I sent this camera back thinking it was defective and asked for a replacement. They sent me my replacement within a few days time. Amazon has awesome customer service. I mean incredible. They have your back every time you buy something. That is why I gave 2 stars. The camera would have gotten one. But dealing with the amazing customer service redeemed this some in my mind. Anyhoo. They sent my replacement camera and it literally was the same exact issues. I mean, no better. So either I got 2 lemons, or this is really not a good camera. The other option, I'm too picky. But honestly, my favorite camera only cost me 45 bucks like 10 years ago and it took better pictures than this one and it was like 8 mega pixels or something like that. I mean I could zoom a picture all the way in without losing clarity and focus.  I wish I could have gotten that one again, but they stopped making it. I am off on the hunt to find another camera that hopefully functions better than this one did. I hope my review was able to help someone decide whether this would work for them. I know how much I use the reviews to decide and how disappointed I was by this one even with all the great reviews it had.

I take all my photos in the lowest resolution for internet transport and I take lots of photos both inside and outside in every condition from very low to bright light.  My last camera was a cheap Samsung which I bought at Costco for like $100 and it worked great until the battery/SD card hinged cover broke off.  I'm very disappointed in this Sony camera. It is almost impossible to get a good photo inside or outside. Every photo comes out dark and I have to lighten it which makes it look washed out.  I will be returning it and buying a Canon based on this link [...]and the recommendation. Found one here on Amazon for a little more than this piece of junk cost me. Hope it works!

If you want to get a clear photo of your favorite artist rocking out on stage, this is not the camera for you. The problem is that it takes so long for the camera to take and focus on a moving object that it comes out a little blurry. I was disappointed needless to say, but if you want to take some pretty nice stills then this is a camera for you. A great gift to give to an aspiring photographer. Overall, great camera for the price and not too expensive to replace if broken.

content：I bought this for my 11 year old son who will be traveling soon with his Grandmother. The reason I chose this one is because it was small and the features seemed quite simple to use. It does not come with a memory card but you can get them on Amazon. But the interface is very easy to use and the menu can be made into a more general less detaile done for a child his age. I love love this small compact sleek camera. It also takes stunning photos.

The Author takes you by the hand, and provides a step by step guideline, that he has personally tested,  and proved to reap results!  No guesswork... no fear of doubt...Just follow his formula, and good fortune will be yours!

time：on April 25, 2016
content：The picture quality is not very good, photos are washed out in even slightly low light, and have horrible glare in daylight. This camera also has no macro. The focus is not intuitive, and is very erratic, most photos come out blurry even when taken on a tripod, with anti shake turned on. I dont consider myself a pro in photography, but I feel like I can work a digital camera pretty well. I think this camera seems to be going for simple ease of use, but it is anything but. This camera makes taking a good photo very difficult.

It takes nice pictures, is easy to use, and has a rechargeable battery that actually lasts a long time on a charge. It doesn't come with an SD card, so you will need to purchase one, but I knew that ahead of time and had some spares, so that was OK with me. Great deal on a point and shoot. nice small & light size to keep in my small travel purse, too.

One day I will take a photo of my phone taking a picture, maybe that will increase the resolution. I like to take photos of my pets - my pet snake and the pet mice I have until they are eaten by the snake :) All in all i highly recommend it to anyone who owns a snake or a pet. Thanks because i think it's awesome.  Let's change the world, one photo at a time.
