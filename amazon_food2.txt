content：There are so many long term benefits to maca root like decreased anxiety and improved skin condition and once I heard about it I was so excited to incorporate it in my meals. Love adding this to my morning smoothies as it's so nutrient rich and gives a nice energy boost. Only thing is that the bitter taste is pretty strong and quite hard to mask but you can work up to it by starting out with smaller amounts. The taste is hard to mask in fruity smoothies and blends in easier in chocolate flavored recipes.

content：This is a thin fine powder Maca that is very fresh. I usually will put this in a smoothie so I don't know what the actual taste is like. It has about twenty servings total in the packaging. I take one teaspoon and place it in the smoothie I am making. There are twenty calories per serving along with four grams of carbohydrates, one gram of protein, one gram of sugar, one gram of dietary fiber and eighty mgs of potassium in this formula. I find that I have increased energy throughout the day while taking this product. It is a good superfood that can be taken on a regular basis.

content：This supplement works exactly as it should. Take 1-3 tsps per day (divided) to get the most benefit from the powder...Maca powder is said to support hormonal health, balance energy levels, supports adrenal health and promotes glowing skin. Maca root has been historically recognized as a "miracle food". It is a tuber, much like the potato, offering a nutrition profile of sterols, amino acids and essential vitamins and minerals. For thousands of years, the Peruvians and Incas used maca root for its healing and nourishing powers. A few ways to use: Smoothies and Juices - Mix 2-3 teaspoons of Viva Labs Organic Maca Powder into to your next smoothie, or into your favorite green juice or carrot juice. The flavor pairs particularly well with chocolate and nut milks, but is versatile enough to complement more savory sips like soup and tea;  Baked Goods - As if brownies and chocolate cakes weren’t enough of a mood booster, you can make them even more so by including maca in the recipe. From sweets to savory treats, Viva Labs Organic Maca Powder can be used for baking, as well as cooking; Maca Ice Cream - No ice cream maker needed to whip up a nutrient-packed frozen treat. Just use a blender to mix 5 frozen bananas, a quarter-cup of almond or coconut milk, 2 teaspoons of maca powder and 1 tablespoon of cinnamon. Before eating, mix in some Viva Labs Goji Berries or Cacao Nibs, or top with your favorite fruit or nuts. Maca’s flavor is complemented by maple, chocolate, caramel, ginger, coconut, and all kinds of nuts, so create your own favorite; and Cereals and Yogurt - Add 1-2 teaspoons of Viva Labs Organic Maca Powder, along with some Viva Labs Cacao Nibs and your favorite berries and nuts to your morning oatmeal. Maca powder also makes a great mix-in for cold cereals and yogurt. Give this supplement a try and you may just love it like I do!

content： When I read about the benefits of Maca I decided to give it a try. I read that it helps with anemia and homeland imbalances, I was hoping I would fine some help in those areas. I got mine from Viva Lab, my family's favorite brand for health food. I can't say enough about their quality. I tried it in my smoothies and was not super crazy about the taste at first. I almost gave up on talking it until I stared feeling much more energized and decided the benefit was worth it. After a week I started to like the taste. I guess it just grew on me. Other surprise benefits that I have found is that Maca helped stabilize my mood and reduce my acne. I am so happy I decided to order it and kept taking it until the taste grew on me. FYI I read Maca looses its benefits if mixed in hot drinks, so keep it cold. I also found that Maca is rich in vitamin B vitamins, C, and E. It provides plenty of calcium, zinc, iron, magnesium, phosphorous and amino acids.

It does alter the taste a little - for me the drinks taste more like lemon when I am adding the macs powder. It is a high quality product, I felt a boost of energy drinking it in the morning. I also used it in my oatmeal and it was good. I would use it with anything containing fruit. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I really like this product and I am happy I could have received it. Thank you!

I only used a very little amount at first because of the supposed problems with digesting it.  I didn't feel any issues and actually felt very good with a boost of energy taking it before my workout.  I took it with my protein shake and really couldn't tell the difference.  I only been taking it for a couple of weeks, but I already feel my mood is better and have more energy to do things.  I didn't have any negative side affects or change in my libido and will probably reorder when the time comes.

I also felt to be not as "moody" as I can usually get during that time of the month. I work an evening shift (4pm to Midnight) so it did help prevent that sluggish feeling towards that midpoint at work where I'm usually ready to crash. Ive mixed it on my smoothies as well as my green drink and the taste is undetectable and it doesnt not change the texture at all. Overall, the quality is what I have  grown to love from Viva Labs as I have many other quality products from them.

It has a very familiar taste to me and I can' t put my finger on what it is, almost like a vegetable taste or a blend of vegetables.  It taste pleasant.  I have put it in my coffee and noticed a more perky feeling throughout the day.  My husband has also been using it in his protein shakes sometimes before and after his workouts.  He said he can really tell a difference since he has been taking the Maca powder, he feels more energy and more focused on his workout regiment.  For me it has helped with concentration in the office and staying focused and getting things done.  I take one teaspoon per day and he is taking 2 per day. As you can see in the picture of the powder close up view the bag is about half empty.  We both highly recommend it for stamina and focus!

I was offered the chance to purchase this at a discounted price on exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion, so I figured now was the time to see what this stuff was all about!  I've been making breakfast smoothies with frozen berries and a little fat free vanilla yogurt in them.  Adding a little of the Maca Powder in there seemed like a good fit, so that's what I've been doing.  Now, this stuff isn't like an espresso that will have you zipping around, then crashing later.  It's more of a slow and steady stream of sustained energy.  Much healthier than the peaks and valleys of energy that caffeine and sugar cause!  I really haven't been brave enough to add this to any other foods or beverages yet.  I have issues with certain textures, and while this blends well enough with my morning smoothie, it does make it thicker so I have to add some almond milk to it.  Which leaves me wondering how it will affect the texture of other foods and beverages.  But overall, I would definitely recommend this for the energy benefits it provides.

Also, the powder form is the most widely available form of the root here in the US. There is no exact dosage instructions anywhere but most web sites agree to start with 1/2-1 tablespoon incorporated into food and to work your way up to no more than 2-3 tablespoons a day. It has only been two weeks since receiving this product but there has been no side effects or upset stomach and energy level does seem increased. The powder has a slightly sweet nutty taste and should be incorporated into foods accordingly. I am hopeful that with continued use the results will become greater and clearer. I am going to start taking this myself as well.

Viva labs is a well known and trusted brand in the dietitian industry to be suggested to our patients with dietary needs. I expecially suggest this product to our male customers because of its lab tested, natural potency to boost sexual performance significantly. Customers who are younger and in school that needs the boost of energy to continue study: Maca powder has shown in our national research that it has statistically significant increase in energy to people who take them. You well feel more awake and energized within 2 days start taking them! This is amazing. I personally often feel tire because of all the lab work and seeing patients, I started to take this product when it first released in the market and my energy level have been much higher and it stayed that way. It's absolutely life changing.

content：It's been a while since I took Maca and I remember my first reaction just after a small bit. It was like a boost, it seemed to supercharge my system. Kind of a "feel good" thing, but different. Hard to describe. So I took the plunge and ordered this product, hoping that it would be what I remembered. I was lucky that I was able to get this product at a discount for my honest opinion. No problem. Some supplements take a bit of time before you can notice a difference in your body, so it's tough to review them.  Not this one! I poured a bit in a spoon and dipped my finger in it and tasted it. Yep! It was the same! To me it's kind of a malty taste, not good, not bad. Not real easy to mix but I found that I could use a jar, add the water and a tsp of Maca and shake. It is so much better than just stirring. I don't know if this was on an empty stomach or not, but I didn't get the reaction that I had first gotten when taking Maca. I was a bit disappointed and just decided to take some every day and see if I felt anything. About two hours later, it was like lightening struck, I could feel energized from top to bottom WOW! Yea! So I read on the package that it is rich in essential vitamins and minerals. Promotes positive mood (who doesn't want that?) Powerful Energy booster. (yep). Maca has a long history of nourishing the body and the new gelatinized supplement is supposed to be superior to the raw.

I still put it in smoothies, sometimes in my hot chocolate,  but I have to think that it would blend in just about any regular drink or food dish very well. Maca is extremely earthy, a little bitter, so only the brave would want to eat it plain. I don't notice the flavor at all in my smoothies. What I do notice is the jump in my step! Having weaned off of coffee, I need not worry about losing those caffeine bursts. This gives me that nearly immediate focus, mental jazzed-up state and energy that really gets my day off to a great start. Maca powder is just amazing. It just makes me feel good and have a good day.When I received the Maca there was a slit on the package,causing a little spillage but I managed to reseal it so no biggie.I purchased this at a discount to review in exchange for my unbiased opinion. however this in no way influenced my review.

It did not leave me with any strange after taste and was easy to camouflage into pretty much anything I added it to. It claims to promote tranquility and relaxation, now I can not speak to that as I did not notice any type of change in that area, but for anyone who knows this to be true, I would recommend this brand for sure.

On the coffee it's good also but I want to to stop taking coffee everyday!  This is a superfood so my wish is to get used with the flavor and take it everyday!i tried maca in capsules before and I did not see results maybe because I took just one capsule!

I decided to mix it into my morning coffee as the easiest way to incorporate it since it should be taken early in the day. I have to mix it in slowly and stir it very vigorously to keep it from clumping. It gives a little different flavor to the coffee but I don't mind it and have actually come to enjoy it. I have definitely felt the added energy I have gained from using it and also I feel clearer headed and able to get more done. You will want to start out with a small amount and work up to more over time to give your digestive system a chance to adapt. I feel that over time I will experience more of the hormone balancing benefits and I'm also excited to try it with my son-in-law who has ADHD as I think it will help his focus as it has mine.

content：I add a tablespoon of this power to my morning smoothie. Its a very fine powder and doesn't thicken my smoothie too much.  I've also used it in hot chocolate as a healthy supplement for my chocolate drink. The flavor is nutty if you haven't had it before. I wouldn't add more than two tablespoons however to any drink. Its not an off putting taste and its not bitter, but maybe too much would give your drink a texture that is too thick. . .sort of like a thinned out pudding.  So my suggestion is to take a little bit daily and you won't even know its there.  According to some websites . . . so I can't guarantee the claims. . .but maca is attributed to increased fertility, hormone balance, booster for the immune system, and  increased energy, stamina, improved sexual function, memory, and focus. I'm generally healthy so I can't say I've felt a dramatic difference after using Maca, but I have not felt horrible either.  Its like any vitamin, you need to just add it to part of your daily diet and hope for the best long term.  I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

I definitely felt more energy during my workouts (less fatigue, can go at a higher intensity, less rest time needed) once this kicked in. Also, I had all day natural energy; not jittery or with heart palpitations. After about 3 weeks I noticed that drop in anxiety and mental clarity/overall sense of well being. I didn't notice a rise in libido until I bumped my daily intake up to 2 teaspoons and later on 3, which skyrocketed my libido! I've stayed at 3 teaspoons a day (3 doses of 1 teaspoon: 1 teaspoon in water with breakfast, one in my pre workout drink, and one post workout) and I'm happy with the results. The only downside was the first two weeks I did notice some moodiness and irritability with my temper, but that subsided after those first two weeks. Oh, and the taste can take some getting used to at first. I can't quite describe the flavor, it's unique. After a couple of weeks I began to not only be able to tolerate it, but kind of enjoy it a little. I can now take it just mixed in water.

Although I am sure that I will need another bag before then. I received this maca powder for free in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.

content：Being a capsule fan of Maca, I liked the Maca Powder when I blended it in my smoothie then drank it very fast.  The taste was chalky and it was gritty like a plant based protein powder.  But, I continue to use it about twice a week and will continue with my Maca capsules.  Thank you for the experience as I received this product complimentary for my honest review.

content：I have been using Maca powder for about a week now. The directions say to use about a tsp in your favorite beverage or sprinkle it on your favorite food. The day I received it, i tried it in a glass of water. I don't recommend that! It has a weird taste. I have not used it on food because of that. I did find, however, that it's not that bad in chocolate milk! It gives a malty flavor and texture. As far as the health benefits-- I have not yet noticed a change. I suffer from anxiety and depression, and have not noticed any increase in mood. Also, my energy levels have remained the same. I haven't noticed an increase in energy either. I am going to continue to use this product in hopes that it changes for the better. I received this product for free, in exchange for an unbiased review. Perhaps I will start to notice a difference soon. I can't wait to see if I do!

It lasts a long time too so while I will likely reorder, it will be a while. I use a teaspoon in my morning coffee and it helps to keep the jitters coffee normally gives me at bay. I like how I feel when I take it and I don't seem to need that afternoon coffee.

It's too bad bc I've researched a lot of its health benefits and it sounds pretty amazing. My mom in her 50s was recommended to take it due to hormone levels that were low making her extremely exhausted. I only have taken it once and I felt good and had a good amount of energy. I'm trying to find ways to disguise the taste. Would be better in a pill form. I received this product in exchange for honest review.

I wasn't sure what to expect as far as how it affected the taste of my smoothies because it does have an earthy smell to it but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I couldn't taste a difference at all when I mixed this in to my drinks. I have not had any digestive issues while using this product and it seems to be gentle on my stomach when digesting. I have used this product for a little over 2 weeks now and I have noticed that I am more energized after using it.  I have also been sleeping better. I used to wake several times a night but now I am finally sleeping through the night and actually waking up feeling refreshed! I have noticed that my moods are better and I am no longer having PMS symptoms. I will definitely continue using this!

I am not here to debate or discuss the potential health benefits- I know Maca is considered an ancient superfood, and there is plenty of info/research available online to back that up. I would need to take this daily for at least 3-4 weeks to be able to comment on its specific health benefits to my body. I did not acquire this for that purpose however- I got it for the taste! I've used it so far in smoothies (maca chai almond) and hot elixirs (hot chocolate maca) and it's delicious. Held up nicely in heat and with ice. I also just finished making raw maca cacao truffles.

content：I was beyond excited to try out this product in exchange for my honest review, but it ended up being a huge let down. I have always been a fan of holistic and natural ways to better your mind and body without having to take tons of medications. The product is described as being able to be mixed in with any drink or food to promote energy and mood enhancement. Let me tell you, I could smell this stuff before I even opened it. The packaging was very nice but once it was opened.. oh lord run away to the hills. I honestly have never smelled anything so foul! It smelled like butt mixed with rotten eggs and roadkill. My mother also got a wiff and gagged. BUT my stepfather had no reaction, so maybe it was just us. The other thing I dislike is that it does not mix into any drink! It clumps up and floats at the top no matter how many times you try to whirl it around. Numerous reviews also state you have to cook this in order to get the health benefits. I am not down with that or the smell. I would avoid this product if you're sensitive to smells!

content：Maca Powder is something that I had never heard of before seeing it on Amazon.  I did some research and found the following information:  "The maca root benefits include a positive effect on hormone balance, energy levels, and a health booster.  And not only is it a natural source of healing nutrition, but it also has a long history of being a safe superfood that has been consumed for its medicinal benefits for thousands of years in regions of the Andes Mountains.  Famous rock Fitz Roy peaks in the Andes Maca is a pleasant tasting root usually available in powder form. It is very rich in nutrients (has a higher calcium level than milk) and is very nutrient dense.  Maca Root benefits include increased fertility in both men and women, hormone balance, booster for the immune system, and  increased energy, stamina, improved sexual function, memory, and focus. (1, 2).  Maca is considered an “adaptogen”, a name given to certain herbs, plants, and natural substances that help the body naturally adapt to stressors like a busy schedule, demanding job, or illness, for example. (3)  Another unique fact about maca root is that historically it has been considered a very potent aphrodisiac and a traditional fertility secret of populations living in the Andes.  Consuming maca often makes people feel more “alive”, energetic, and leaves them with a sense of well-being, all of which are thought to be due to its ability to restore proper hormone balance and elevate “feel good” endorphins. Another benefit of maca is its relatively high amount of absorbable plant-based nutrients, including protein, fiber, calcium and magnesium, among others."  After reading about it, I decided to order this product.  After I received this product, I decided to add it to my daily protein shake, to make it healthier and so I would be sure to take it each day!  It's hard for all of us to eat healthy, on a daily basis.  So I feel that by adding Superfoods to our diet, we are able to eat as healthy as possible!  I received yhis product for free, or at a greatly reduced price, in exchange for my fair and honest opinion.  I truly do like this product and would recommend it to anyone who really cares about being their healthiest self!!

Here is my review which is based solely on whether it meets or exceeds the claims made by the vendor/manufacturer in their description of the product and my personal experiences and observations with the item in testing.  It is beyond the scope of this review to confirm the claims made regarding the value of Maca Powder, although I will say that I seemed to feel a bit calmer during the day after mixing the powder in my breakfast mix.  Each individual will need to make up their own mind regarding its long term affect.  I also will assume that individuals purchasing Maca Powder have some idea regarding its taste.  I will say that the powder does have a distinct flavor for which I assume individuals develop a taste.  It is strong and distinct – for which Maca Powder is known.  I found that the powder is extremely easy to blend into cereal, drinks, and mixes.  It dissolves very quickly and completely.  It gives a unique color of yellow to the host into which it is mixed.
