content：Although I follow the news and try to keep up with what is going on in the Middle East, it is not always easy to imagine.  This author, having been born in Afghanistan, paints a very vivid picture of life in Afghanistan before and after the war over there, the war torn cities, and the effects on the lives of the citizens.  His character also spent time in Pakistan, then returned to his current home in the United States, all the while revealing the sharp contrasts among the areas traveled.  Finally, the struggles of the immigrants to adjust to their new country were highlighted. Although "Kite Runner" is a work of fiction, it is written in the first person and feels very much like an autobiography. This book kept my attention from wandering.  I enjoyed it very much!!

content：Quite frankly, The Kite Runner is one of the best novels I have ever read. The tragic story of a boy who struggles to find the courage to confront his mistakes of the past easily comes to life in Hossieni’s depiction of friendship, betrayal, and overall, redemption. Born into a wealthy family, Amir lives a comfortable life, rare to most citizens of Kabul, Afghanistan during a time of war. Hosseini’s portrayal of Amir is not only relatable but also disappointing. Amir is like every human being on the face of the planet, faulty. Throughout the course of his life, he makes poor decisions in order to avoid the repercussions of his own mistakes. Amir’s actions’ resulting from the selfish fears he holds are painstaking to read about and makes him look like a coward. However, don’t we all sometimes let our selfish fears prevent us from following in the footsteps of virtue? And if so, then aren’t we all just cowards?  On the other hand, Hassan, the epitome of a loyal and honorable friend, lives in a dilapidated hut with his father, serving Amir’s father Baba. Hassan is an appealing character because of his sincerity and unconditional love for Amir, which is incredibly admirable. Hassan not only cleans up after Amir’s messes but also pays for his mistakes. Like brothers, Amir and Hassan spend their childhood together, flying kites and playing in the streets of Kabul. As the story unfolds, Amir finds himself, like many of us do, in the midst of an internal conflict between his yearning to tell the truth and his fear of the consequences of his actions. He suppresses his guilt of the past until an opportunity for potential redemption arises. The tale of Hassan and Amir’s friendship is heartbreaking yet written so eloquently that even I felt the hardships faced by the two Afghans. Hosseini has a talent for creating unexpected plot twists throughout the novel which left me engrossed, never wanting to place the book down. The Kite Runner consistently kept me on the edge of my seat; it is a fast-paced story without a single dull moment to spare. The author’s vivid illustration of Amir’s life made me feel every emotion known to mankind. His use of symbolism and the thematic portraits of loyalty, betrayal, and redemption are consistently found throughout the novel. Also, through Hassan’s struggles, Hosseini reveals the degrading treatment of minority groups in Afghanistan during the time of political turmoil. The Kite Runner is the ultimate tear-jerker; it is an astonishing account of the pain that comes with disloyalty and war. Overall, I highly recommend The Kite Runner. Through my experience I can proudly say it is one of my favorite books of all time.

reviewer：Amazon Customer
time：on March 1, 2016
content：n Hosseini's eloquent and beautifully written novel, he writes about Amir, a Sunni, who throughout his life went through struggles and harsh situations, while making decisions that affected him throughout his entire life. He begins his story in Kabul, Afghanistan while spring was upon them. Hosseini tells a sorrowful story about the collapse of a friendship between a son of a wealthy businessman, and the son of the servant who provides for the house of Amir. Hassan, the servant for Amir’s household, whom was a Shi’a, had a close friendship with Amir, although though they couldn’t be friends in public due to the Sunni and Shi’a difference. In Afghanistan the rich were able to afford education and become educated;  Amir was born in a wealthy family, he is a sad soul, intelligent, and knows how to read and write sensationally. The bosom story is a rollercoaster of situational issues. All the while, Afghanistan was facing hardships of its own; the story unravels during the time of the People’s Democratic party of afghanistan where at first it was being ruled by Russians, and later in the story by one of Afghanistan's very own.

Author Khaled Hosseini did such a brilliant job at exposing the world to a novel that moves yet disturbs the reader, reaching into the emotions and triggering the switches of hate, love, neglect, and most importantly, redemption. With this novel, our minds have been given a bleak painting of the pain and exhaustion that men and women still live with in the Middle-East.

There are plot twists and revelations galore, and the author provides much food for thought in this beautifully written tale.

content：I had to read this for school but ended up falling in love with it. Khaled Hosseini does a wonderful job drawing from his own experiences to bring the environments and characters in the book alive. The plot, while turbulent, will hook almost any reader in emotionally and wont let go until you finish the book. The way Hosseini depicts the Taliban and politics in Afghanistan around the time the book was placed was also spot on, only adding more to the story. The story generally follows two young boys, Hassan and Amir, and their friendship throughout the Russian invasion in Afghanistan. They come from very different paths of life, as Amir is wealthy while Hassan is a poor servant who is discriminated against for being an ethnic minority in Afghanistan. They grow to be great friends, although their friendship falls apart along with the country they live in. All together, a very great novel.

content：There are many fine things in life that bring us joy. Getting a 100 on an exam, getting engaged to the love of your life and winning the lottery, to name a few. But perhaps the most pleasant thing in all this world is reading a good book, especially a book that you had no expectations for what-so-ever. That’s what my experience with the Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini was like. I’m 15 years old going on 16, so naturally, reading is the one thing I want to do the least. I thought that I would have to force myself to read this book for the sake of my grade. Dreading the normally tedious task that is reading, I hesitantly opened the book. What I did not know, however, was that I was opening a new chapter of my life. As soon as my eyes skimmed across the first sentence, I was hooked. Hosseini has a masterful command of diction and it really shows in the Kite Runner. His syntax is truly wonderful and it makes this book one of the greatest I’ve ever read. But perhaps the greatest quality of this book and Hosseini’s writing is his characterization and development. The way he writes the main character to be so likable yet be so dishonest is something I’ve only ever seen in Breaking Bad, and that is heralded as one of the greatest television show of all time. No only is Amir’s character extremely well written, but so is Hassan’s. The transformation of their character and their relationship after certain events transpire is amazing and adds so much depth and conflict to the novel. The fact that Amir would do anything for his father’s affection, even if that means to neglect Hassan, is such a terrible quality for a person to have, yet Hosseini makes it work so beautifully in the book. Tying in to Amir’s deplorable character (as a child, anyways) is the theme of betrayal, but also of redemption. Amir wants nothing more than to regain Hassan’s friendship after the incident, but is too afraid to do anything, to say anything. He simply lets the guilt build up inside of him until he can’t contain it anymore, but by then it’s too late. Many years later, Amir redeems himself when he is given the opportunity to do so, even if it requires him to venture to a once beautiful and cultured land that now runs red with blood and is stained by conflict and war. Amir leaves his wife and child to go and make it up to someone who he hasn’t seen in over 20 years and that shows how far Amir’s character has come from his kite running days. Reading this book has truly been one of the greatest reading experiences of my life and has easily become one of my favorite books of all time.

content："The Kite Runner" by Khaled Hosseini follows the epic tale of Amir and his Shi'ite servant friend Hassan. Amir is a Sunni male, and to the distaste of his father, is unusual. Amir is always buried in his books, shows no interest in athletics, and is cowardly. His defender is his loyal servant and companion, Hassan. "The Kite Runner" takes place in both Kabul, Afghanistan, and California. When Amir is a young boy, he experiences the Soviet invasions and the terror of the Taliban as a young man. The book provides insight on these historical moments, as well as the culture of the Afghans. The discrimination of the Shiites and the lifestyle of Afghans is displayed.

content：New York Times Bestselling author, Khaled Hosseini wrote the novel “The Kite Runner.” This extraordinary, genuine, and remarkable novel illustrates and depicts the life of the narrator; Amir, a young boy living in the Middle Eastern Hemisphere, in addition to Amir, it shows the relationships he has with the people around him. His best friend, Hassan, father, Rahim Khan, Soraya, and Sohrab are the main people that shared a relationship with Amir. The narrator lived in a very affluent household and was a part of a very privileged class; although he did not feel very fortunate. The Kite Runner tells the story of the upbringing of Amir as he matures. The story takes place in Kabul, Afghanistan for most of the book, during the time of a chaotic and grotesque war. During the time of fighting and chaos, Amir and Baba, his father, flee to the Western United States, California. Amir takes these events as an opportunity, not only to flee war but also to flee his traumatic past. Throughout all of his experiences, his past followed him like a shadow. With rue, he and his heart felt as if it could never be pure. In the events that trailed his adulthood and the start of his family, he eventually went back to where it all started, his homeland. He went back with the intent of seeking an ill, old family friend. His journey back home shone light on the many themes of the story; the thematic elements go as far as the broad topic of Love, Forgiveness, to social class and ethnic tensions, to the Immigrant Experience, and finally to Betrayal and Redemption. During his visit, not only did he look in on Rahim Khan and talk for hours about their past and life at the moment, but they also talked about saving his long lost nephew from orphanage and danger. War continues to haunt the lives of innocent bystanders of all ages, the elderly, adults, adolescents, children, and little babies. War has overtaken the lives of Afghans, filled with the haunting of bombings, gunshots, and death. Children of the neighborhood Amir grew up in have now perished, dead and gone, resting in peace. Growing up, Amir wasn’t much like his father, which displeased him, he was calm and collected, quiet, read for fun, and did nothing for himself. When it came to standing up for himself, he would freeze up and Hassan would do the fighting for him. Because of his persona, there were family issues, betrayals, and secrets. The biggest secret, about his father, wasn’t even told to him by his father, and wasn’t unveiled until he was a grown man of thirty-eight years of age. Amir learns to deal with this pain and eventually redeems himself. “The Kite Runner” is by far one of the best books I have ever read. The book was so well-written, so vivid and engaging, I couldn’t seem to put it down. (496)
