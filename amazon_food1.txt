time：on June 15, 2016
content：Good snack. I'm unsure how to feel about the packaging. Not a commentary about these bags more of a generalization about individual wrapped items. I like that they promote portion control and they are versatile. Great for daily outings to the park or pool and a good snack size for kids to take to school. However, the amount of trash created makes me cringe and it does nothing to help limit my footprint on Earth.

reviewer：Sarah King
time：on December 6, 2015
content：I love popchips, don't get me wrong, but I was really disappointed after I stopped by safeway to get 2 bags for me and my friends to try. Now these definitely aren't bad tasting, but the most dominant flavor is salt, not spice. They might as well have added some black pepper to a barbecue chip. I'm not even spectacular with spicy foods. Chips would have been much less of a letdown if they'd been labeled as mild heat or something.

time：on October 8, 2015
content：Popchips are my favorite chips because they are not greasy, they taste lighter and they have a lovely crunch to them.  I'm not very fond of spicy flavors so I prefer the sweet potato and the sea salt popchips over the zestier flavors.  I especially like the individual, lunch-sized packages because then I don't have to weigh out a serving to have with my lunch.  When confronted with a 3 ounce bag of chips, I'm much more likely to eat the entire bag than to divide it into portions.  As a Weight Watcher, having this size bag with my lunch only adds 2 points and it's worth it to me.

All 4 flavors are good and you don't feel as though these chips aren't as good as full fat and salty chips. This product is a winner with me.

score：3.0 out of 5 stars
reviewer：Laine
time：on May 19, 2016
content：Received order as promised and in good condition.  My reason for the rating is because the product was 1 month from expiration and typically, the ones I buy are usually more than 12 months away.  I think this greatly affected the product along with a "medicinal" to "pet food" type taste to the chips.  I don't think they were stored in adequate temperature, because the texture and the flavor of the salt and vinegar was very weak...almost non-existent.  Also, it stated "no gmo" on the package, which I don't see on the ones I purchase.  When I looked at the type of products sold by the vendor, it kind of made sense.  So, I've learned my lesson.  Ask before purchasing, temperature of storage where food items are kept and ask if "no-gmo" is on the face of the bag, don't buy it.

time：on September 6, 2015
content：Horrible.  I'm not sure how this product has gotten so many glowing reviews.  I bought a bag locally.  While the flavoring leaves nothing to be desired, they are BONE dry, and pretty bland in the potato department.  I found it ironic that the back of the bag states that they don't bake their product, because doing so creates a product "too much like cardboard".  Pfffffffff!  These are 1000% more cardboard-like than ANY baked chip I have had, without question.  I'm sure these help some people as a dietary aid, and even though I'm looking for that exactly... if the chips are so dry that I have to dunk them in calorie ladden dips to make them edible, what, exactly, is the point?  I will be going back to those baked products that they take the p**s on.
