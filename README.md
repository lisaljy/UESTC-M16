### Web spider for Amazon customer review
Every time when we want to buy something online we will glance through the customer review to see if the product is really what we want. However, it takes time for us to go through every line of the review. Therefore I am thinking about to make a web spider to help us collect the information online and find the key words in the content to help us make decision ~
