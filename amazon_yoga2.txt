time：on April 5, 2016
content：I purchased this strap for physical therapy.  Overall, it is a good product, however, my one complaint is with the buckle.  Some of the exercises my therapist has me doing at home put a lot of tension on the strap.  Under high tension, the strap slips through the buckle and lengthens until I have to stop and readjust the length.  I finally had put the strap through the buckle and then tight a knot at the buckle to keep the strap from slipping under tension.  With a different buckle, this would be a 5 star product.  The ineffective buckle ruins the usefulness of the strap.

In other words, this strap is better than most of the ones many of you may have used in your practice as well.  It is 8ft vs. 6ft, strong & firm and very well sewn.  I'm very tall and the extra length allows me to do some stretches that weren't permitted with the smaller strap.  Also, I've gotten two of the nicest emails from the owner, Ellie....obviously very conscientious people with pride in their product and concern for their customers.
