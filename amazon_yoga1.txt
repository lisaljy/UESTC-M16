Similar products for sale at yoga stores in my neighborhood sell for around $100, do this was a great buy. Easy to unroll and reroll. Doesn't slip on floor, nor does it stretch our feel unstable as I work out. Highly recommended!.

contentï¼šI've always liked to exercise, so I had an old fitness mat, but that one was really old so I decided to buy a new one. I didnt want to spend a lot of money on a mat so I bought this one. When it came I was in love with the color and all, and the first days it was okay. But then I noticed that I couldn't press too much on the mat or else it'd leave marks all over it(it has a lot of marks now) and whenever I tried to do exercise like push ups or whenever I had to put my hands in a certain position for a long time I always end up slipping because they sweat a lot. However, the product does its job, but you get what you paid for, maybe it's more useful for yoga. It's kinda big and thick so it's not THAT portable.

In fact, the opposite is true. I strongly advise against using this mat for yoga for several reasons.

It provides adequate cushion to protect my knees and elbows from my hardwood floors. It also didn't have an overpowering smell out of the package. My only issue with it is that it's a little squeaky and can get loud when I move in an out of different stretches, however this doesn't really bother me. Other than that, think it's a great deal for the price for anyone looking for a thicker mat.

contentï¼šI'm a 6'4" 202lbs male, I enjoy hot yoga as well as slow-paced stretching yoga. This mat does not work for me in hot yoga when I sweat too much. When I'm in downward facing dog, the mat is constantly stretching itself out to my weight as well as being slippery from my sweat. It also squeaks a lot on the surface of the studio. My hands and feet slide all over the place. I used it twice and would just prefer the mats they have at the studio. I love the thickness of it, but it just doesn't work for me.

contentï¼šGreat yoga mat with enough thickness you do not feel like you are on a hard floor. The carrying strap makes it really convenient when you are ready to roll this thing up and leave class. It also is a nice color/design not distracting and it is pretty long will accommodate your taller people around 6ft and up.
topicï¼šPerfect mat!

contentï¼šGreat length. Works well on carpet.  No slipping.  As a Pilates newbie I was concerned about working out in bare feet due to arthritis and bone spurs. I had no problems with foot pain during or after workout.  Very pleased!

contentï¼šI bought this mat and had it sent to my parent's home, so I could exercise while visiting. I loved it!  It had a slight odor, but not off putting. It provided good traction, and seemed very durable. Most of all, I loved its thickness. I was able to exercise on it, with it it directly on cement, and was totally comfortable, but not too soft to get in the way or alter the exercises. It has adjustable straps (with velcro), so they can be used no matter how tight or loose it is rolled up. Great mat!
