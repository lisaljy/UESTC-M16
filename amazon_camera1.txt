contentï¼šThis camera is so cute I love the size and the color! I've been using this camera to document my summer and so far it has taken beautiful photos if you're into polaroids. The camera is easy to maneuver and I love how you can change the light settings based on where you are taking the photo. Simple but great camera!

This camera is not only super easy to use, but the greatest thing to take along when you go on vacations or are just hanging out with friends! Everyone is always so fascinated by it and its great to capture fun memories with. It came just as pictured, and with all the instructions you need. I'd recommend checking out some Youtube tutorials on how to use the camera just in case! But it's super simple to use and to put film in.

contentï¼šI had such high hopes for this camera.  I've wasted an entire roll of film already -- the pictures have a smear down one side, so I'm assuming that something is too "tight" where the picture pops out, and that it's streaking the picture.  Also, the pictures are sooooo tiny, and not very crisp, either.  Waste of money.... find yourself the old fashioned polaroidÂ

contentï¼šI absolutely love this.  It is just a small polaroid camera from a time ago.  The pictures are small, like 2" by 3" or so.  You set what environment, (such as outside sunny, outside cloudy, inside) on the camera to help ensure a good picture each time.  The only setback I have is the film is not cheap.  The cheapest I could find was a 10 picture pack of film for $12.97.

I gave the filled book to the birthday girl at the end of the party.  She loved it.....  Also, some guests requested to keep their picture because they liked them so much.  Fortunately, I bought enough film to accommodate some requests......  Highly recommend this camera.

I don't expect an instant photo to be photographer quality,  but I also didn't expect them to be this poor. I wouldn't buy again.  I wish I bought the full size instant camera.

contentï¼šI'll change this review if I ever get this camera to work.  The instructions are terrible.  I found an online video explaining how to use it.  The minus battery sits slightly higher than the plus battery (I don't know if this is normal but it would not push down evenly).  The plus and minus signs on the outside of the battery case are opposite of the illustration.  I can't figure out how to attach the wrist strap.  Nothing happens when I push the button to take a picture.  I wasted 1 pack of film in case I had put it in wrong (I had not).  I tried to use new batteries in case the batteries that came with the camera are too old but now I can't get the battery compartment open.  There is no way the camera can fit in to the case.  Like I said, I'll upgrade this review if I get the camera to work.  Otherwise I'll return the camera and the case.

I'm still getting used to how to set the flash to the correct setting since we've had a few pictures come out kind of dark but it's been so fun. The actual pictures are smaller than what we had back in the day and you have to purchase those separately. Quality of the picture actually surpassed my expectations. When I have the settings set correctly the picture comes out really nice.We wanted something that would produce pictures instantly, reasonably priced and something our kids could use. We found it with this fun camera.

contentï¼šThe Fujifilm INSTAX Mini 8 automatically focuses for your shot. It captures photos like a point and shoot digital camera. I'm 27 with a 16 month old toddler. I haven't had film developed for about 10 years. With that said being a 90ied kid this is a throwback to those small sticker picture cameras! It's lot of fun to point, click and have a real photo print out! It's very easy to use I didn't even use the directions to figure it out. Anyone who's used any electronics in the past 5 years can use this easy. The Pictures themselves look like my families old photo albums of the 50ies-80ies. They have a beautiful nostalgia to them and are tangible to hold. They also fit perfectly into the drivers license window inside my wallet. I literally ordered over 200 shots of film and like 10 albums. They come out like the old Polaroid floppy photos just smaller! Great buy and affordable price!

contentï¼šAbsolutely love this!!! I bought it for myself for my birthday last year and I use it all of the time. I adore how the pictures turn out and it is perfect when traveling. I took it on my trip to Cancun and was able to get gorgeous pictures by the pool and the beach. My whole family loves it as well!

contentï¼šGot this as a gift in August 2015. Still amazing quality as when I first bought it! I absolutely love this camera and all my friends have one and love theirs as well. The film is cheaper than that of its competitors products and affordable too. The excitement of watching the film slide out and develop takes you back to the era of film cameras.

contentï¼šWas very excited to get this product to complete my husband's 40th white party theme. We had black books out for guests to add photos and notes with a white pen. It was looking amazing until 26 photos in the flash stopped working! We wasted loads more film trying to get it to work, replacing batteries and film. Sadly the flash never worked again so the album came to a halt.

contentï¼šThis is a great Polaroid camera. The camera is very attractive and looks great. It is very simple to use with one button to turn it on and one button to take the picture. There is a dial on the lens for different settings such as sunny, cloudy, etc. To close the camera, all you need to do is push the lens down and it closes. I got this as a pack with this, the film, and the carrying case. All three were a great purchase and this product is absolutely something that I will continue to use down the line. The only con is that the camera is quite bulky. However, this is to be expected from a Polaroid Camera.

contentï¼šI intially purchased this for a music festival but I have used it way more than I thought I would. It's easy to put in a purse or backpack for vacations or day trips. I love the light pink color and how easy it is to work the camera. I like that there are different settings around the camera lense. This makes it easy to get the best picture possible in any environment you are in. I've had no problems with pictures not turning out. Overall I'm very happy with the camera.

contentï¼šI love it when this thing works.  Very hip and the pictures turn out very 70's.  Unfortunately, even when changing the settings appropriately, the lighting is very sensitive and we have been unable to get a decent picture in anything but broad daylight.  Sometimes it's too bright and the picture turns out nearly white, sometimes it's too dark and the picture turns out nearly black.  I still think this camera was worth the investments even with the light difficulties because the pictures that HAVE turned out are splendid and we love them.  They look really great hanging from a string with mini clothes clips.

contentï¼šGot this camera and have hardly used it primarily because the picture quality is very average and the film is ridiculously expensive.  If you're looking for something that takes average photos with muted colors  (not super clear and bright like your phone or digital camera) this is for you.  I think the photos in the ads must have been digitally altered because mine certainly look nothing like those.  This is definitely more of a gimmick than anything else.  Fun to have fairly immediate photos in your hand but it would be nice if they were of a quality that is something to write home about.

contentï¼šwhen you buy this, be realistic in expectations, its for fun. I got this as a fun little gift for a friend and she loves it but quality is terrible and the exposure levels and everything about it isn't high-quality, do expect to get shots that are just whited out because of lighting and the exposure. I've had better luck for instants on older polaroid's but this is a fun toy, it does cost a lot in the end do to the instant film.

contentï¼šThe camera is really cool looking & easy to use. The film is very expensive. I've tried many different methods of using the camera but I still find the actual photos it takes are hit or miss. Some look good, most are too bright because the flash goes off no matter what. I've tried to cover the flash, but it's a shot in the dark (pun!) whether your pic will come out good. Even my good photos are not that great, and the price of the film makes me want more from my shots.
